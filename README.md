AppletCatcert DI
================

This is a modified version of the applet offered by Catcert (http://www.catcert.cat). It is based on version 2.0.0
which was (as far as I know) the latest version in which the source code was publicly downloadable without former request.

**NOTE:**: The lastest vresion is available in https://github.com/ConsorciAOC/Applet-de-signatura

New feaures in 2.0.0
====================

New parameter (show_content) for showing / hiding the content to sign. It is useful for end user due to now, they are not completely sure what are signing.
It is recommended to use in conjunction with "appletLogo" set to "".
